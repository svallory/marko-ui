name: marko-ui
description: Use when a project has a components.json from marko-ui, or when installing, using, editing, or debugging marko-ui components (shadcn-style components for Marko 6 backed by Zag.js) — finding a component, reading its API, adding it with the marko-ui CLI, fixing a component that renders but misbehaves, or setting marko-ui up in a new project. Not for general Marko 6 syntax (see marko6) or routing (see marko-run).

# marko-ui

[marko-ui](https://marko-ui.saulo.tech) is shadcn/ui for Marko 6: accessible components whose behavior comes from Zag.js state machines and whose styling is Tailwind v4. **Use the `marko-ui` CLI for everything below — do not hand-write a component that the registry already ships, and do not guess a component's props.**

Run the CLI with the project's package runner (`bunx marko-ui`, `npx marko-ui`, `pnpm dlx marko-ui`). Every command is non-interactive when stdin is not a TTY: confirmations are taken as yes, `init` uses its defaults, and `add` with no component names exits 2 instead of opening a picker.

## First: which distribution is this project on?

Read `distribution` in `components.json` (absent means `copy`). It changes how components are obtained and customized.

| | `copy` (default) | `import` |
|---|---|---|
| Components live in | the project, under the `ui` alias (`src/components/ui/<name>/`) | `node_modules/@marko-ui/shadcn` |
| Get a component | `marko-ui add <name> -y` | nothing to add — import `@marko-ui/shadcn/ui/<name>/<name>.marko` |
| Customize | edit the component file (it is the project's code) | override `mu-*` hook classes from the project stylesheet |

No `components.json` means marko-ui is not set up: run `marko-ui init` (add `--agents` to also write the agent docs).

## Workflow

1. `marko-ui search -q <query>` — find a component (`--json` for machine output). It matches whole words against each item's name, title and description, so extra words are matched better and items matching none of your words are left out. Every item costs context, so search before guessing a name. The installed ones are listed in the project's `AGENTS.md`.
2. `marko-ui docs <name>` — usage, props, keyboard contract, and examples as markdown. **Read this before writing markup for a component you have not used in this session.** `marko-ui docs --list` prints the index.
3. `marko-ui show <name>` — the registry item as JSON; `--files` lists what would be written, `--deps` lists npm and registry dependencies.
4. `marko-ui add <name> -y` — install (copy distribution). `--dry-run` previews the file changes; `--overwrite` replaces local files.
5. `marko-ui diff <name>` — compare local edits against the registry version.
6. `marko-ui doctor --json` — health checks; exit code 3 means something is broken and each failed check names its fix. Run it after `init`/`add` and before reporting the work done.
7. `marko-ui agents sync` — refresh the component list in `AGENTS.md` after adding or removing components.

`marko-ui manifest` prints every command, flag, exit code, and error code as JSON when you need the exact surface.

## Using components

```marko
import Dialog from "../components/ui/dialog/dialog.marko";
import Button from "../components/ui/button/button.marko";

<let/open=false/>

<Dialog open:=open>
  <@trigger|props|>
    <Button ...props>Edit profile</Button>
  </@trigger>
  <@title>Edit profile</@title>
  <@description>Make changes to your profile here.</@description>
  <p>Form fields go here.</p>
</Dialog>
```

- **Parts are attribute tags** (`<@trigger>`, `<@title>`), not separately imported subcomponents. `marko-ui docs <name>` lists each component's parts.
- **`<@trigger|props|>` hands you the machine props** to spread onto whatever element you render. It is the equivalent of Radix's `asChild`.
- **State binds with `:=`** (`open:=open`, `value:=value`, `checked:=checked`), or pass the value plus its `xChange` handler (`open=open openChange=(v) => { open = v }`).
- **On the copy distribution `add` also generates a taglib** (`marko.json`), unless the project already has its own `marko.json`, so installed components are usable as tags without an import (`<Button>`, `<CardHeader>`). An explicit import always works too.
- **Never import a component as `Input`.** It shadows Marko's reserved props type. The input component is imported as `TextInput`.

## Pitfalls that break components silently

Each of these has caused a real bug. Check your code against the list before finishing.

1. **Controlled props pin the machine.** `open=` / `value=` / `checked=` WITHOUT the matching `openChange` / `valueChange` / `checkedChange` (or the `:=` bind) freezes the component in that state. For an initial value only, use `defaultOpen=` / `defaultValue=` / `defaultChecked=`.
2. **Boolean `aria-*` / `data-*` attributes serialize wrong.** Marko renders boolean `true` as a bare attribute: `aria-selected=(bool)` emits `aria-selected=""` and `data-active=(bool)` never matches a `data-[active=true]:` Tailwind variant. Wrap in `String(...)`.
3. **Nothing from Zag crosses a tag boundary or lives in state.** Machine services and `api` objects contain functions and cannot be serialized for resume. Pass plain data, or a closure written in the template (`parentApi=() => api()`), and call `api()` at the use site.
4. **Do not read a parent component's `api()` inside a child's attribute-tag body.** Route it through the child's input as a closure instead. The symptom is `TypeError: ... is not a function` after an overlay opens.
5. **Overrides that do nothing (import distribution).** The style layer must be imported with `layer(components)` and the matching `@custom-variant style-<name>` line must exist in the project's stylesheet. Both fail silently.
6. **Unstyled components (copy distribution).** The theme stylesheet is not loading. Check that the file recorded as `tailwind.css` in `components.json` is imported by the root layout and that `@tailwindcss/vite` is in the Vite config. `marko-ui init` wires both; a hand-rolled setup often misses one.
7. **`"Cannot find module @zag-js/..."` or `marko-zag`.** A component's npm dependencies are missing. `marko-ui add` installs them; `marko-ui show <name> --deps` lists them.

For Marko 6 language rules (`<let>`, `<const>`, `<for>`, event handlers, TypeScript in templates) use the `marko6` skill; for `@marko/run` routing use `marko-run`.

## Editing a component (copy distribution)

The file is project code. Each `.marko` file starts with a `static const styles = { ... }` block holding the Tailwind classes per part: change classes there. Interactive components wire their machine with one tag, `<zag/api=() => machine from=input/>`, which picks the machine's props out of `input` and returns the `api` getter; keyboard handling, focus management, and ARIA come from the machine, so restyling cannot break accessibility. After editing, `marko-ui diff <name>` shows what diverged from the registry.
